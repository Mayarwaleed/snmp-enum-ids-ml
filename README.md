# snmp-enum-ids-ml
This project implements a Machine Learning–based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect SNMP Enumeration attacks using a self-generated dataset captured from a real lab environment.  SNMP Enumeration is a reconnaissance attack where an attacker sends repeated SNMP queries (UDP port 161) to extract sensitive system information.
